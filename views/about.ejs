    According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/pop-culture/praise-worry-why-fretting-can-be-good-you-ncna757016">research</a>, about 85% of the things we worry about don't actually happen. What makes worrying unhealthy
    for a person is the fact that it involves situations that have not happened yet or that may not happen at all. This
    could unfortunately lead to anxiety-related disorders which is why it is important to find a coping method for worrying.

    "Worrying takes up cognitive resources; it's kind of like people who struggle with worry are constantly multitasking - they
    are doing one task and trying to monitor and support their worries at the same time." says Hans Schroders, a psychology student and clinical intern.
    A <a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/for-worriers-expressive-writing-cools-brain-on-stressful-tasks">study</a> conducted at Michigan State University found that students who wrote down their thoughts and feelings performed a particular task more efficiently,
    using less brain resources, as compared to students who didn't write down their thoughts and feelings. This was measured using electroencephology
    (EEG). The students who wrote down their worries were essentially able to "offload" their worries which is why they were able to complete
    the task more efficiently. This app is designed to do the same thing.

  <p>Advantages of writing down your worries include:</p>
      <li>Helping you notice the more important worries or problems and prioritizing them</li>
      <li>Keeping track of any triggers for worrying and learning how to control them</li>
      <li>Provides an opportunity for self-reflection and focusing on positive things</li>
